This 3D slicer module combines pixel intensity information from input volumes of equal size to give an output volume containing information from each of the input volumes. An example is shown below with an ARFI ultrasound (left) and Bmode ultrasound (center) pixel values being averaged to give the CombinedVolume seen on the right image.
